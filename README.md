# :gift::christmas_tree: Advent of Code 2024 :christmas_tree::sparkles:

These are my solutions to this year's [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).

Solutions make use of `cargo-aoc` code helper ([here](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc)).

## Solutions

All solutions linked below:
| Day | Title | 1 :star: | 2 :star: | Solution | Rating |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| [01](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1)  | Historian Hysteria              | 60.3µs | 66.5µs | [day01.rs](./src/day01.rs) | :christmas_tree: |
| [02](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/2)  | Red-Nosed Reports               | 20.1µs | 98.8µs | [day02.rs](./src/day02.rs) | :grin::sweat:    |

## Notes
1. Day 01 part 2 was improved, initially giving a result of 69.69µs
2. Two solutions for day 2 - one arithmetic, and another using a state machine. Both are comparable.
